## Description:
With a team, we have to conceive and execute a design of Interactive Front-End Application that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Also we have to learn about agile development methodologies to help us work collaboratively. We'll implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.
